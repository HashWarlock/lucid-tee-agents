Add a first-class Express adapter powered by `@lucid-agents/agent-kit-express`, including x402-express paywalling, request/response bridges, and a smoke test. Expose the new adapter through `@lucid-agents/create-agent-kit` with scaffolding assets, template support, and updated CLI/documentation so projects can be generated with `--adapter=express`.
